# Pixelfed Glitch Docker Images

Forked from the [in-repo Dockerfiles](https://github.com/pixelfed-glitch/pixelfed/tree/dev/contrib/docker) primarily because I wanted nginx as the web daemon and something to publish to use in a Helm chart.

Tags are rebuilt daily so you should use the SHA hash if mutability concerns you.

Images at docker.io/jessebot/pixelfed-glitch

Available tags:

## Attribution

This repo is a fork of the a repo managed by Matt Kulka <matt@lqx.net>, so that we can use pixelfed-glitch. Check out their chart upstream if you want to use vanilla pixelfed, as it's great! :)
